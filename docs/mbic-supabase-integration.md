# MBIC Dashboard Data Integration Summary

## Current Status
- Netlify dashboard still reports `Revenue YTD ≈ $234,465` despite Supabase showing `$6,136,413.93` for 2025.
- Sales drilldowns only show complete totals for reps whose invoices fall inside Supabase’s default 1,000-row window (e.g., Angela Milazzo). Other reps are truncated, so their combined revenue never reaches the authoritative YTD total.
- Local `npm run build` fails unless Supabase environment variables are present during prerendering, which blocks automated verification ahead of deploy.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Date Window Drift**  
   - `fetchOrganizationSalesOverview` previously defaulted to `new Date()` for start/end bounds, meaning any server still in 2024 would fetch `2024-01-01` → `2025-01-01`.  
   - Result: Revenue YTD and the trend chart only reflected early 2024 invoices (~$234k).
2. **Request-Level Caching**  
   - `fetchSalesRange` was wrapped in React’s `cache(fetchSalesRange)`. The first Netlify render (when only Jan–Feb data existed) populated the cache; every subsequent request re-used that stale snapshot, so new invoices never appeared.
3. **Supabase Row Limits & Auth Context**  
   - Client-side helper `lib/supabase/queries.ts` used the anon browser client without an explicit `.limit()`, so Supabase returned its default maximum of 1,000 rows.  
   - Reps with more than 1,000 invoices (or later invoices beyond that window) were truncated. Angela’s totals looked correct because her invoices all fell inside the first 1,000 rows.

## Fixes in Place
1. **Data-Year Resolution** (`lib/db/sales.ts`)  
   - Added `resolveReportingWindow()` to query Supabase for the latest `invoice_date` and derive the reporting year, ensuring all YTD calculations align with the dataset instead of server clock drift.
   - Sales KPIs now rely on RPC-backed helpers (`lib/mbic-sales.ts`) instead of raw invoice loops, so every request rehydrates totals directly from Postgres.
2. **Admin Client Everywhere** (`lib/supabase/queries.ts`, `lib/mbic-sales.ts`)  
   - Replaced the anon browser client with the service-role admin client and bumped `.limit(1000000)` for `sales_demo`, `customers_demo`, and `sales_reps_demo`.  
   - Guarantees that per-rep, per-collection, and dealer breakdowns load the entire transactional history the UI expects while the new RPC helpers provide pre-aggregated datasets for dashboards.

These changes bring the backend queries in line with Supabase’s authoritative totals when run locally with valid credentials.

## Data Flow Overview
1. **Source of Truth**: Supabase schema  
   - `sales_demo` provides invoice-level facts (amount, customer, rep, date, collection).  
   - `customers_demo` and `sales_reps_demo` enrich the fact table with names and assignments.
2. **Backend Aggregation** (`lib/db/sales.ts`)  
   - `fetchSalesRange` issues server-side admin queries with optional filters (rep, dealer, date range).  
   - Helpers derive monthly totals, dealer aggregates, rep aggregates, and active-dealer counts before returning a structured `OrganizationSalesOverview`.
3. **Frontend Consumption**  
   - Dashboard (`app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`) calls `fetchOrganizationSalesOverview()` during server rendering, surfaces `grandTotal`, `monthlyTotals`, dealer/collection/rep aggregates, and KPIs.  
   - Sales page (`app/(dashboard)/sales/page.tsx`) invokes `fetchRepSalesData(repId)` for the selected rep, rendering trends and dealer breakdown tables.  
   - Shared marketing/sales widgets rely on `lib/supabase/queries.ts`, which now streams complete tables via the admin client.

## Remaining Risks & Next Steps
1. **Deployment Environment**  
   - Ensure Netlify has `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` available at build time; without them, server prerendering returns `TypeError: fetch failed`.
2. **Cache Busting**  
   - With React’s cache removed, add explicit ISR/`revalidate` policies if you want to control frequency of Supabase round trips while keeping the data current.
3. **Verification**  
   - After the next deploy, validate the live dashboard against the Supabase SQL snippet to confirm Revenue YTD and per-rep totals align with `$6,136,413.93`.
